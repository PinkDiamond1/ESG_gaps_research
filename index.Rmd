# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This document is the continuation of the paper *Options for Improving
Use of ESG data for Sovereign Bond Analysis* (World Bank 2018).
Following interaction with investors in sovereign bonds that use ESG
indicators in their country analyses and risk/return profiles of
sovereign securities, the World Bank Group (WBG) presented a set of
options for improving accessibility, quality (e.g. timeliness and
regularity of publication, geographic coverage) and transparency of
Emerging Markets data, in particular for ESG data. This paper aims to
continue the analysis, better understand underlying data production and
management issues that affect availability and provide recommendations
for improving the accessibility, quality and coverage of ESG indicators.
