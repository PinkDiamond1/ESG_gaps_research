Please do not cite or distribute without permission of the SARTSD This document is the continuation of the paper Options for Improving Use of ESG data for Sovereign Bond Analysis (World Bank 2018). Following interaction with investors in sovereign bonds that use ESG indicators in their country analyses and risk/return profiles of sovereign securities, the World Bank Group (WBG) presents a set of options for improving accessibility, quality (e.g. timeliness and regularity of publication, geographic coverage) and transparency of Emerging Markets data, in particular for ESG data. This paper aims to continue the analysis, better understand underlying data production and management issues that affect availability and provide recommendations for improving the accessibility, quality and coverage of ESG indicators.

["esg-availability.html", "Section 2 ESG availability 2.1 Availability of ESG indicators by country", " Section 2 ESG availability 2.1 Availability of ESG indicators by country The availability of ESG indicators by country is dynamic over time. as shown in figure 1, not all indicators are available in all countries neither they are available in all years. The bottom left of the chart shows the less available indicators, whereas the top right of the chart shows the most available indicators. From a different perspective, the availability of indicators goes from red to blue. Several insights are drawn from this chart. 2.1.1 Low coverage Some indicators have very low availability over time. In general, YYY (ppp%) indicators are available for less than 100 countries in average over time. Yet, not all indicators with low coverage have the same characteristics. For instance, Indicator is available since the beginning of the 80’s. Indicators like Gross National Savings or Adult literacy rate are available since 1980. However, they are available YYY countries in average each year. Indicator is available every few years. Indicators like Internal renewable freshwater resources or Net migration are available for more than 160 countries but only every five years. Something similar happens to PM 2.5 air pollution, but after 2010 this indicator becomes available every year rather than every five years. High availability only in recent years. Some indicators like Terrestrial and marine protected areas or Strength of legal rights index have a high country coverage but low time span. The former started on 2016 with a coverage of 195 countries, whereas the latter started on 2013 with a coverage of 173 countries. Another indicator that started relatively late is Scientific and technical journal articles. It started on 2003 for about 180 countries but has a three-year gap as it is only available until 2016. 2.1.2 Remarkable improvement over time There are a few indicators that show a remarkable improvement in country coverage over time. Despite their early appearance in the beginning of the 1980’s, indicators that come from household surveys such as the Poverty headcounts or Gini index have shown a dramatic improvement in country coverage in the beginning of the 2000’s. The coverage improved from about five countries in the 80’s to more than 70 countries per year in the decade of the 2000’s. However, these indicators suffer from a compilation lag that requires more than two years from time or recollection to the time of publication. Other indicators, especially the ones related to the governance component. have improved the frequency of publication. For instance, Governance effectiveness, Political stability and absence of violence, and Voice and accountability were collected every three years at the decade of 1990, but increased their frequency to every year since the 2000. 2.1.3 Remain stable over time but with middle coverage All the indicators with a stable yellow vertical line are characterized by being stable over time but with a country coverage around 120 countries per year. Among those, we could find Prevalence of HIV in adult population, non-residents patents application, or Physicians per 1,000 people. 2.1.4 High coverage and sudden decline With the exception of a few indicators like Ease of doing business index or Total tax and contribution rate, most recent value (MRV) of most indicators is two or more years old. However, some indicators with remarkable good coverage in the previous decade suddenly declined in the last five years. For instance, CO2 emissions has a yearly coverage of 188 countries until 2014 and thereafter it suddenly declined to one country, Sudan. A similar story happened to Net energy imports, Electricity production from nuclear sources, or Hospital beds. However, this final set of indicators did not have such a good coverage as CO2 emissions before the decline. 2.1.5 high coverage Finally, the indicators at the right side of the chart present the best country coverage over time. They are characterized by their intense blue color. For instance, Population density, Adjusted savings: mineral depletion, or Land area have a remarkable and stable high country coverage.

["variability-of-esg-indicators.html", "Section 9 Variability of ESG indicators", " Section 9 Variability of ESG indicators ESG indicators belong to set of measures with wide diversity. Some of them are estimated every few years, whereas others are produced every three or six month. In addition, some indicators are bounded by construction–like percentages or indexes–, others are normalized across countries–like indicators in PPP values–, others are in units based on population size–like all those in x by 1,000 people–, among many other kinds of measures and units. This variety makes it difficult to compare directly one indicator to another, especially if any sort weight is going to be assigned all the indicators. (#fig:esg_var)Figure 2. Density of coefficient of variation of ESG indicators To alleviate this problem, a standard measure of variability could be applied to all indicators. Those indicators that vary the most, deserve the most attention by investors, whereas those that vary the less could be revisited every few years to recalibrate models. To make variability comparable across countries, it was necessary to rescale all indicators and linearly interpolate missing values by year. Then, the coefficient of variation (CV) was estimated at indicator/country level in order to capture to temporal variability of each indicators in each country. Finally, an average of CVs across countries is calculated to get measure of variability at the indicator level. Figure 2, shows the distribution of such estimates. Most indicators have a CV of 1.41, with light mass spanning from 0 to 1 This id a long paragraph (#fig:c_i_var)Number of countries per indicator over time "],
