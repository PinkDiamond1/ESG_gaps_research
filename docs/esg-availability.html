<h1>
<span class="header-section-number">4</span> ESG availability</h1>
<p>The availability of ESG indicators by country is dynamic over time. as shown in figure 1, not all indicators are available in all countries neither they are available in all years. The bottom left of the chart shows the less available indicators, whereas the top right of the chart shows the most available indicators. From a different perspective, the availability of indicators goes from red to blue. Several insights are drawn from this chart.</p>
<div id="low-coverage" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Low coverage</h2>
<p>Some indicators have very low availability over time. In general, 36 (17.91%) indicators are available for less than 100 countries in average over time. Yet, not all indicators with low coverage have the same characteristics. For instance,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Indicator is available since the beginning of the 80’s</strong>. Indicators like <em>Gross National Savings</em> or <em>Adult literacy rate</em> are available since 1980. However, they are available YYY countries in average each year.</li>
<li>
<strong>Indicator is available every few years</strong>. Indicators like <em>Internal renewable freshwater resources</em> or <em>Net migration</em> are available for more than 160 countries but only every five years. Something similar happens to <em>PM 2.5 air pollution</em>, but after 2010 this indicator becomes available every year rather than every five years.</li>
<li>
<strong>High availability only in recent years.</strong> Some indicators like <em>Terrestrial and marine protected areas</em> or <em>Strength of legal rights index</em> have a high country coverage but low time span. The former started on 2016 with a coverage of 195 countries, whereas the latter started on 2013 with a coverage of 173 countries. Another indicator that started relatively late is <em>Scientific and technical journal articles</em>. It started on 2003 for about 180 countries but has a three-year gap as it is only available until 2016.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="remarkable-improvement-over-time" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Remarkable improvement over time</h2>
<p>There are a few indicators that show a remarkable improvement in country coverage over time. Despite their early appearance in the beginning of the 1980’s, indicators that come from household surveys such as the <em>Poverty headcounts</em> or <em>Gini index</em> have shown a dramatic improvement in country coverage in the beginning of the 2000’s. The coverage improved from about five countries in the 80’s to more than 70 countries per year in the decade of the 2000’s. However, these indicators suffer from a compilation lag that requires more than two years from time or recollection to the time of publication.</p>
<p>Other indicators, especially the ones related to the governance component. have improved the frequency of publication. For instance, <em>Governance effectiveness</em>, <em>Political stability and absence of violence</em>, and <em>Voice and accountability</em> were collected every three years at the decade of 1990, but increased their frequency to every year since the 2000.</p>
</div>
<div id="remain-stable-over-time-but-with-middle-coverage" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Remain stable over time but with middle coverage</h2>
<p>All the indicators with a stable yellow vertical line are characterized by being stable over time but with a country coverage of about 120 countries per year. Among those, we could find <em>Prevalence of HIV in adult population</em>, <em>non-residents patents application</em>, or <em>Physicians per 1,000 people</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="high-coverage-and-sudden-decline" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> High coverage and sudden decline</h2>
<p>With the exception of a few indicators like <em>Ease of doing business index</em> or <em>Total tax and contribution rate</em>, most recent value (MRV) of most indicators is two or more years old. However, some indicators with remarkable good coverage in the previous decade suddenly declined in the last five years. For instance, <em>CO2 emissions</em> or <em>Renewable electricity output</em> had a yearly coverage of more than 180 countries until 2014/15 and thereafter it suddenly declined to one country, Sudan, for <em>CO2 emissions</em> or zero countries for <em>Renewable electricity output</em>. A similar story happened to <em>Net energy imports</em>, <em>Electricity production from nuclear sources</em>, or <em>Hospital beds</em>. However, this set of indicators did not have such a good coverage as <em>CO2 emissions</em> before the decline.</p>
</div>
<div id="high-coverage" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> high coverage</h2>
<p>Finally, the indicators at the right side of the chart present the best country coverage over time. They are characterized by their intense blue color. For instance, <em>Population density</em>, <em>Adjusted savings: mineral depletion</em>, or <em>Land area</em> have a remarkable and stable high country coverage.</p>
