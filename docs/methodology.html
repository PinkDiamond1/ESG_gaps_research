<h1>
<span class="header-section-number">2</span> Methodology</h1>
<p>It is first necessary to define what is meant by a “data gap” as several phenomena could be construed
as being a “gap.” For instance, data could be unavailable for a number of relevant economies, or there
could be gaps in the time series over a relevant time period. There could also be gaps in metadata and other
documentation. While all of these are potentially relevant, the most important gaps in the context of ESG
likely involve the most recently available values compared to the current time period, since ESG
analysis concerns investment decisions being made today and in the near future. Accordingly, this paper
defines a “data gap” as a significant difference between the current calendar year and the most recent available value(s)
(MRVs) for the indicators and economies under study. Gaps in metadata or in time periods before the MRV
are not a primary focus of this analysis.</p>
<p>To better understand the nature of data gaps we consulted with data management experts at the World Bank to
identify a list of explanatory factors which are described below. These “explanations” are defined such that they can be used
to consistently “tag” indicators to which they apply. They are particularly relevant to time series statistics.
Using metadata in the World Bank API and interviews with members
of the data management team, we examined each indicator through the lens of these explanations and recorded the results
as dummy variables in a metadata database. It is possible that multiple explanations apply to any given indicator.</p>
<p>The results of this tagging exercise were used to build a database along with other relevant metadata.
The final database assembled for analysis has a total of 48 variables for a total of 134 indicators. 44 indicators are
environmental indicators, 66 are social indicators, and 24 are governance indicators. The World Bank is the primary source of 36
indicators, whereas the UN system is primary source of 66 indicators, and other organizations are the source for 32
indicators.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Description of Explanations</h2>
<div id="ideal-case" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Ideal Case</h3>
<p>The World Bank API defines 217 countries and economies. Indicators that had observations for 2018 or later (this research
was conducted in 2019) for at least 196 countries (90%) were considered “non gap” indicators and were not tagged with
any further explanations. This category also includes 4 indicators comprised of modeled projections for future time periods.</p>
</div>
<div id="a.-dropped-or-deprecated" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> A. Dropped or Deprecated</h3>
<p>While most major World Bank time series databases are updated on regular schedules, it is common for individual indicators
and occasionally entire databases to be discontinued. This can occur if the original provider or program discontinues
support for the data, or if policies, programs, or methodologies evolve such that the data are no longer relevant.
In these cases, the time series is no longer updated with recent observations, and the series becomes increasingly obsolete.
Deprecated indicators in the WDI are typically removed and are available only in the <a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/wdi-database-archives">WDI Archives</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> the indicator only exists in a discontinued or “archived” database, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/wdi-database-archives">WDI Archives</a> (API source=2)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/africa-development-indicators">Africa Development Indicators</a> (API source=11)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> indicators tagged with this explanation are considered inactive and remaining explanations are not considered.</p>
</div>
<div id="b.-no-longer-updated" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> B. No Longer Updated</h3>
<p>In other cases, an indicator may remain in an active database but fall out of active maintenance. This may be the case as a precursor
to Explanation A above, or it may be attributable to lapsed oversight, i.e., there is no longer a person or team responsible
for the indicator (e.g., program termination, department reorganization, personnel changes). In these cases as well, the time series
becomes increasingly obsolete as it is no longer updated.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> the indicator has no observations for any country for the last five years (2014-present)</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> indicators tagged with this explanation are considered inactive and remaining explanations are not considered.</p>
</div>
<div id="c.-methodology-lags" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.1.4</span> C. Methodology Lags</h3>
<p>Some indicators by their nature may be especially time consuming to produce. For instance, if an indicator relies on
administrative data or other underlying raw information, it cannot be calculated until that source is published. These
source dependencies may be subject to their own production schedules and timeliness issues. The effect may be that an indicator
may only be available significantly later than the time period of its observations.
These delays may be compounded if multiple dependencies are involved.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> classification under this explanation was made through consultations with subject matter experts.</p>
</div>
<div id="d.-curation-lags" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.1.5</span> D. Curation Lags</h3>
<p>In many cases the World Bank is a distributor of indicators it obtains from dozens of external parties.
There is some level of “curation” overhead costs to obtain, collate, validate and finalize data from these independent
sources, and this overhead may itself affect data availability compared to that of the original sources.
This may be especially true where the production cycle of the original indicator varies from that of the Bank’s curation team;
for instance, an indicator published monthly by the original source may only be updated quarterly or annually by the World Bank.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> classification under this explanation was made through consultations with the data curation team.</p>
</div>
<div id="e.-licensing-constraints" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.1.6</span> E. Licensing Constraints</h3>
<p>In some cases, the World Bank distributes indicators under legal agreements that affect its availability. The most common
case are licenses that stipulate that the Bank cannot distribute the latest version of a dataset in order to protect that
dataset’s value in cases where providers sell the data commercially. Thus, while more recent data may exist, the Bank is
legally prevented from distributing it for a period of time, which can consistute a significant availability gap.</p>

</div>
<div id="f.-survey-dependencies" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.1.7</span> F. Survey Dependencies</h3>
<p>Some indicators are calculated from underlying <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=1656">microdata</a> obtained from
household-level or firm-level surveys conducted in country. The survey process constitutes a unique kind of methodological lag.
Surveys themselves are costly, and are frequently implemented irregularly or according to schedules that vary signficantly by country.
As a result, data availability may vary not only by time but by country.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> classification under this explanation was made through consultations with the data curation team.</p>
</div>
<div id="g.-limited-relevance" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.1.8</span> G. Limited Relevance</h3>
<p>Some indicators may not be relevant to or may not be interesting in the context of certain groups of economies. For example,
very small economies may not have significant natural resource endowments or particular kinds of economic activity for particular
indicators to be meaningful. Indicators designed to measure use of, say, forests or mineral deposits, or levels of trade, may
be assumed to essentially be zero or “too small to measure.” Similarly, other indicators may not be relevant to industrialized
economies, such as prevalence of certain diseases (thought to be eradicated), literacy rates, or foreign aid.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> this explanation was considered for high-income “rich” countries (using the WBG income classification) and small economies,
defined as those with populations under 120,000. This threshold represents a “natural” breakpoint at which population jumps by nearly
40 percent, clearly differentiating economies above and below it. For both “rich” and “small” economies we identified a set of indicators
for which at least 80% of economies had no observations at all. From these results we removed indicators that we still considered
potentially relevant to rich/small economies despite the lack of available data.</p>
