# Methodology

*Start with: what is a data gap? In this case it's particularly focused on MRV*

To better understand the nature of data gaps we consulted with experts in data management at the World Bank to
identify a list of explanatory factors which are described below. These "explanations" are defined such that they can be used
to consistently "tag" indicators to which they apply. They are particularly relevant to time series statistics.
Using metadata in the World Bank API and interviews with members
of the data management team, we examined each indicator through the lens of these explanations and recorded the results
as dummy variables in a metadata database. It is possible that multiple explanations apply to any given indicator.

## Description of Explanations ##

### Ideal Case ###

The World Bank API defines 217 countries and economies. Indicators that had observations for 2018 or later (this research
was conducted in 2019) for at least 196 countries (90%) were considered "non gap" indicators and were not tagged with
any further explanations. This category also includes 4 indicators comprised of modeled projections for future time periods.

### A. Dropped or Deprecated ###

While most major World Bank time series databases are updated on regular schedules, it is common for individual indicators
and occasionally entire databases to be discontinued. This can occur if the original provider or program discontinues
support for the data, or if policies, programs, or methodologies evolve such that the data is no longer relevant.
In these cases, the time series is no longer updated with recent observations, and the series becomes increasingly obsolete.
Deprecated indicators in the WDI are typically removed and are available only in the [WDI Archives][wdi-archives].

**Definition:** the indicator only exists in a discontinued or "archived" database, including:

* [WDI Archives][wdi-archives] (API source=2)
* [Africa Development Indicators][adi] (API source=11)

**Notes:** indicators tagged with this explanation are considered inactive and remaining explanations are not considered.


### B. No Longer Updated ###

In other cases, an indicator may remain in an active database but fall out of active maintenance. This may be the case as a precursor
to Explanation A above, or it may be attributable to lapsed oversight, i.e., there is no longer a person or team responsible
for the indicator (e.g., the original manager took another position or retired). In these cases as well, the time series
becomes increasingly obsolete as it is no longer updated.

**Definition:** the indicator has no observations for any country for the last five years (2014-present)

**Notes:** indicators tagged with this explanation are considered inactive and remaining explanations are not considered.

### C. Methodology Lags ###

### D. Curation Lags ###

### E. Licensing Constraints ###

### F. Survey Dependencies ###

### G. Limited Relevance ###

For explanation G, we tried getting GDP sector information for small economies, but this
is all there is (unlisted countries have no GDP data):

## Database description

The final database assembled for analysis had a total of 35 variables for a total of 138 indicators. 47 indicators are environmental indicators, 25 governance indicators and 66 social indicators. The World Bank is the source of 26 indicators, of which 10 each are environmental and social indicators respectively and 6 are governance indicators. Organizations pertaining to the UN system are a source for 53 indicators of which 41 social indicators, 8 environmental indicators and 4 governance indicators. 57 indicators are sourced from different organization grouped under the term of other organization. 29 of these indicators are environmental, 15 are social  and 13 are governance indicators.
